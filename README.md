# This project is a school group project related to web application development. Together with my team, we created a web application for selling games, and I was responsible for the front-end development.
# For the Front-End, I utilized HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. While designing the game site, I employed components such as div, header, nav, article, aside, and footer.
# The game site consists of 6 game categories, each hosting 4 games of its own.
# There is a table specifying the features of each game, and users can add games to their shopping cart by clicking on the cart icon and specifying the quantity.
# Additionally, the site includes categories such as FAQ, Help Center, Suggestions, About Us, and Contact.
# Users can register and log in to the site, with a dedicated profile page for their information.
# The features related to games and users are visible through the database and back-end development, which were implemented by my teammates.
